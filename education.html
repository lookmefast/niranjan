			<h1>Bachelor of Networking
			<br><span>MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY</span></h1>
			<p>March 2022 - Present
			<br>In MIT, I discovered that there are proper wireless internet connections as well as contemporary computer labs. There is also campus security and a first aid centre to make students feel safe. There is a contemporary library as well as the most recent electronic information services available here. As a student, the major thing I appreciate about this institution is that it is located in the city town hall, so we can easily get here by bus, rail, boat, or automobile.

			<h1>High School
			<br><span>CAPITAL SECONDARY SCHOOL</span></h1>
			<p>August 2018 - August 2020
			<br>I graduated from Emerald Academy with an academic GPA of 3.35 and from Capital Secondary School with an academic GPA of 3.43 . These two stated locations provided me with the opportunity to study and expand my skills. As a result, I am grateful to these locations for allowing me to travel to my favourite destination i.e Australia, to complete my studies.
